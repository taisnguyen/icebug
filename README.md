## 
[Icebug][icebug] is an open source library for high-performance
graph analysis backed by read-only memory. Due to its heritage, it also supports network/graph analysis on read-write memory, but it can be 5x more CPU and 5x more memory efficient when using columnar memory such as Apache Arrow.

Its aim is to provide tools for the analysis of large
networks in the size range from thousands to billions of edges. For this
purpose, it implements efficient graph algorithms, many of them parallel to
utilize multicore architectures. These are meant to compute standard measures
of network analysis. Icebug is focused on scalability and comprehensiveness.
Icebug is also a testbed for algorithm engineering and
contains novel algorithms from recently published research (see list of publications below).

Icebug is a Python module. High-performance algorithms are written in C++ and exposed to Python
via the Cython toolchain. Python in turn gives us the ability to work interactively and a
rich environment of tools for data analysis and scientific computing.
Furthermore, Icebug's core can be built and used as a native library if needed.

## Requirements

You will need the following software to install Icebug as a python
package:

- A modern C++ compiler, e.g.: [g++] (&gt;= 8.1), [clang++] (&gt;= 6.0) or MSVC (&gt;= 14.20)
- OpenMP for parallelism (usually ships with the compiler)
- Python3 (3.9 or higher is supported)
  - Development libraries for Python3. The package name depends on your distribution. Examples: 
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install python3-dev`
    - RHEL/CentOS: `dnf install python3-devel`
    - Windows: Use the official release installer from [www.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- [Pip]
- [CMake] version 3.6 or higher (Advised to use system packages if available. Alternative: `pip3 install cmake`)
- Build system: [Make] or [Ninja]
- Cython version 0.29 or higher (e.g., `pip3 install cython`)
- Apache Arrow development libraries (libarrow-dev)

## Install

In order to use Icebug, you can either install it via package managers
or build the Python module from source.

### Install via package manager

While the most recent version is in general available for all package managers, the number of older downloadable versions differ. 

##### uv

    uv pip install icebug

More system-specific information on how to install Icebug on Linux, macOS (both Intel and M1) and Windows-systems can be found [here](https://networkit.github.io/get_started.html).

### Building the Python module from source

    git clone https://github.com/Ladybug-Memory/icebug icebug
    cd icebug
    python3 setup.py build_ext [-jX]
    pip3 install -e .

The script will call `cmake` and `ninja` (`make` as fallback) to compile
Icebug as a library, build the extensions and copy it to the top folder. By
default, Icebug will be built with the amount of available cores in
optimized mode. It is possible the add the option `-jN` the number of threads
used for compilation.

## Usage example

To get an overview and learn about Icebug's different functions/classes, have a look at our interactive [notebooks-section][notebooks], especially the [Icebug UserGuide]. Note: To view and edit the computed output from the notebooks, it is recommended to use [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter-notebooks]. This requires the prior installation of Icebug. You should really check that out before start working on your network analysis. 

We also provide a Binder-instance of our notebooks. To access this service, you can either click on the badge at the top or follow this [link][binder]. Disclaimer: Due to rebuilds of the underlying image, it can takes some time until your Binder instance is ready for usage.

If you only want to see in short how Icebug is used - the following example provides a glimpse at that. Here we generate a random hyperbolic graph with 100k nodes and compute its communities with the PLM method:

    >>> import networkit as nk
    >>> g = nk.generators.HyperbolicGenerator(1e5).generate()
    >>> communities = nk.community.detectCommunities(g, inspect=True)
    PLM(balanced,pc,turbo) detected communities in 0.14577102661132812 [s]
    solution properties:
    -------------------  -----------
    # communities        4536
    min community size      1
    max community size   2790
    avg. community size    22.0459
    modularity              0.987243
    -------------------  -----------

Icebug also offers two ways to load a graph from CSR format enabling zero-copy loading of large graphs using Arrow tables

    >>> import pyarrow as pa
    >>> from icebug_format import IcebugMemGraph
    >>> nodes = pa.table({"id": pa.array([0, 1, 2], type=pa.int64())})
    >>> rels  = pa.table({"source": pa.array([0, 1, 2], type=pa.int64()),
    ...                   "target": pa.array([1, 2, 0], type=pa.int64())})
    >>> mem = IcebugMemGraph.from_arrow_tables(nodes, rels)
    >>> g = nk.graph.Graph.fromIcebugMemGraph(mem)

    # using fromCSR directly
    >>> indices = pa.table({"target": pa.array([1, 2, 0], type=pa.int64())})
    >>> indptr = pa.table({"row_ptr": pa.array([0, 1, 2, 3], type=pa.int64())})
    >>> g = nk.graph.Graph.fromCSR(3, True, indices, indptr)

Note: Properties in IcebugMemGraph are pyarrow tables, so, node and edge tables could contain properties, whereas the fromCSR method only supports loading the graph structure, so no properties are supported.
If the resolved CSR column is already a single `uint64` chunk, `fromIcebugMemGraph`
keeps it zero-copy; chunked columns are combined and integer columns are cast to
`uint64`, which allocates.

## Install the C++ Core only

In case you only want to work with Icebug's C++ core, you can either install it via package 
managers or build it from source. 

### Install C++ core via package manager

##### conda (channel conda-forge)

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install libicebug [-c conda-forge]

##### brew

    brew install libicebug

##### spack

    spack install libicebug

### Building the C++ core from source 

We recommend [CMake] and your preferred build system for building the C++ part of Icebug.

The following description shows how to use [CMake] in order to build the C++ Core only:

First you have to create and change to a build directory: (in this case named `build`)

    mkdir build
    cd build

Then call [CMake] to generate files for the `make` build system, specifying the directory of the root `CMakeLists.txt` file (e.g., `..`). After this `make` is called to start the build process:

    cmake ..
    make -jX

To speed up the compilation with make a multi-core machine, you can append `-jX` where X denotes the number of threads to compile with.

### Use NetworKit as a library

This paragraph explains how to use the Icebug core C++ library in case it has been built from source. 
For how to use it when installed via package managers, best refer to the official documentation ([brew](https://brew.sh), [conda](https://docs.conda.io), [spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest)). 

In order to use the previous compiled icebug library, you need to have it installed, and link
it while compiling your project. Use these instructions to compile and install Icebug in `/usr/local`:

    cmake ..
    make -jX install

Once Icebug has been installed, you can use include directives in your
C++\-application as follows:

    #include <icebug/graph/Graph.hpp>

You can compile your source as follows:

    g++ my_file.cpp -licebug


### Unit tests

Building and running Icebug unit tests is not mandatory.
However, as a developer you might want to write and run unit tests for your
code, or if you experience any issues with Icebug, you might want to check
if Icebug runs properly.
The unit tests can only be run from a clone or copy of the repository and not
from a pip installation. In order to run the unit tests, you need to compile
them first. This is done by setting the [CMake] `NETWORKI_BUILD_TESTS` flag to
`ON`:

    cmake -DNETWORKIT_BUILD_TESTS=ON ..

Unit tests are implemented using GTest macros such as `TEST_F(CentralityGTest, testBetweennessCentrality)`.
Single tests can be executed with:

    ./networkit_tests --gtest_filter=CentralityGTest.testBetweennessCentrality

Additionally, one can specify the level of the logs outputs by adding `--loglevel <log_level>`;
supported log levels are: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL`.


### Compiling with address/leak sanitizers

Sanitizers are great tools to debug your code. Icebug provides additional [Cmake] flags
to enable address, leak, and undefined behavior sanitizers.
To compile your code with sanitizers, set the [CMake]
`NETWORKIT_WITH_SANITIZERS` to either `address` or `leak`:

    cmake -DNETWORKIT_WITH_SANITIZERS=leak ..

By setting this flag to `address`, your code will be compiled with the `address` and the `undefined` sanitizers.
Setting it to `leak` also adds the `leak` sanitizer.
